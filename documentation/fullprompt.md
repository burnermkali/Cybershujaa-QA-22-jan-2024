### Slide 4: Fundamentals of Quality Assurance
**QA Fundamentals: What Is It?**
- QA = systematic process to ensure software meets quality standards  
- Key Principles: Prevention > Detection, Continuous Improvement, User-Centric  
- QA (process-oriented) vs QC (inspection-oriented)  
- Real-World Example: Preventing bugs in cybersecurity tools at Serianu  

**Key Concepts**
- Quality Assurance focuses on preventing defects
- Quality Control focuses on finding defects
- Both are essential for delivering high-quality software

**Visual**: QA vs QC Venn diagram + simple process flowchart

### Slide 5: Real-World Practice of QA
**QA in Action: Real-World Practice**
- Daily Tasks: Test planning, execution, reporting, dev collaboration  
- Challenges: Flaky tests, tight deadlines, changing requirements  
- Success Story: Caught critical vulnerability in privacy tool → prevented data breach  
- Tip: Always document failures using structured templates  

**A Day in the Life**
- Morning: Review test results, triage bugs, plan test scenarios
- Afternoon: Execute tests, write automation scripts, collaborate with developers
- Evening: Document findings, update test cases, prepare reports

### Slide 6: The Role of QA in Reliable and Secure Systems
**QA's Role: Building Reliability & Security**
- Reliability: Consistent performance under load (stress/load testing)  
- Security: Finding vulnerabilities (SQLi, weak auth, etc.)  
- Impact: Prevents downtime, data loss, compliance failures  
- Example: Simulating attacks in cybersecurity products like VulnCare  

**Why It Matters**
- 95% of breaches due to human error
- QA helps catch issues before they reach production
- Security testing is as important as functional testing

**Visual**: Lock + gears icons + statistic: "95% of breaches due to human error"

### Slide 7: Key Testing Methodologies
**Key Testing Methodologies**
- Manual: Exploratory, usability-focused  
- Automated: Regression testing (Playwright, Selenium, Cypress)  
- Levels: Unit → Integration → System → Acceptance (UAT)  
- Modern: Agile/DevOps – Shift-Left, CI/CD pipelines  
- Specialized: Performance, Security (OWASP), Accessibility  

**Testing Pyramid**
- Unit Tests (base): Fast, many, isolated
- Integration Tests (middle): Medium speed, moderate number
- E2E Tests (top): Slower, fewer, comprehensive

**Visual**: Testing pyramid + pros/cons table

### Slide 8: QA in Modern Software Development
**QA in Modern Software Development**
- Agile/Scrum: Daily standups, sprint reviews  
- DevOps: Automated pipelines → faster, safer releases  
- Shift-Left: QA involved early in design  
- Benefits: Less rework, better collaboration  

**Modern Practices**
- Continuous Integration: Tests run on every commit
- Continuous Deployment: Automated releases with quality gates
- Test-Driven Development: Write tests before code

**Visual**: Agile cycle with QA highlighted + DevOps infinity loop

### Slide 9: QA in Cybersecurity Environments
**QA in Cybersecurity: High-Stakes Testing**
- Challenges: Phishing, ransomware, zero-day exploits  
- Methods: Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning  
- Compliance: GDPR, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS  
- Example: Validating defenses in VulnCare, ThreatCare, PrivacyCare  

**Security Testing Focus**
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Data encryption validation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security configuration review
